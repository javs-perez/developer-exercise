== README

Here are the execercises that you asked of me. I decided to make a Rails application
that implemented all three excercises. I hope I met all your requirements.

Thank you for the opportunity.

To start the app please follow these instruction:

```
rake db:migrate
rails s
```

Then visit `localhost:3000` and you will be able to see a list of link to the respective excercises


To run tests please follow these instructions:


```
rake db:test:prepare
bundle exec rspec
```
